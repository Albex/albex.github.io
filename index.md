## Welcome at Albex's

I'm Alexandre Camus but I'm more often known as Albex on the web. You will find here useful links of my major projects. 
You will also find my résumé and my LinkedIn webpage.

## Projects

I have been working on several projects. All my projects are stored in [my Github account](https://github.com/Albex "My repository").
Here is a short list of the major ones.
* [JLPS](http://albex.github.io/LPS "JLPS"): Final year project for the MSc in Advanced Computing in Imperial I'm doing.
* [This web site](https://github.com/Albex/albex.github.io "albex.github.io"): you might want to have a look at the source files of this very website.

## Résumé

I will very soon upload my CV. [Here](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=172862272&trk=hb_tab_pro_top "LinkedIn profile") is my LinkedIn profile.
